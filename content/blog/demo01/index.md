Kubernetes The Hard Way

Famous repo by Kelsey Hightower. There are several derivations for different platforms. They all have in common, that they are real hard :-)

The original:
GitHub - kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way: Bootstrap Kubernetes the hard way on Google Cloud Platform. No scripts.
https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way

Kubernetes The Hard Way On VirtualBox:
GitHub - mmumshad/kubernetes-the-hard-way: Bootstrap Kubernetes the hard way on Vagrant on Local Machine. No scripts.
https://github.com/mmumshad/kubernetes-the-hard-way

Kubernetes the Hard Way Raspberry Pi
GitHub - robertojrojas/kubernetes-the-hard-way-raspberry-pi: This tutorial is inspired by the Kelsey Hightower's Kubernetes The Hard Way tutorial, but targeted to the Raspberry Pi.

The following certifications are the certifications you should focus on when walking the Kubernetes certification path:

Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA)
Good entry point if you're new with containerization and Kubernetes.
This certification is comparable with AZ-900 of Microsoft.

Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
The tough one :-) For those who want to administrate (even bare-metal) Kubernetes clusters.
It is 2 hours and consists of appr. 15-20 questions. It's completely working in a lab enviroment with multiple, different K8s environments (no multiple choice or whatsoever). You will need hands-on experience in K8s environments, both working nodes and control plane nodes. The above mentioned video course by Mumshad Mannambeth is highly recommended.
